# GTM & Enablement Methodology

### ⚔️ Competitive Battlecards & Intelligence
I believe a great battlecard isn't a feature list—it's a roadmap to winning. My process includes:
* **Win/Loss Audits:** Analyzing Gong calls to identify exact moments of friction.
* **Objection Handling:** Creating "Silver Bullet" questions that shift the prospect's focus to our unique platform advantages (e.g., real-time data vs. legacy reporting).

### 🎨 Pitch Deck & Narrative Design
For the **Nava HQ launch**, I developed a slide architecture that prioritized:
* **The "Aha!" Moment:** Leading with the pain of manual workflows before introducing the tech solution.
* **Persona Mapping:** Creating modular decks that adjust the "Value Hook" based on whether the buyer is in Finance, HR, or Operations.

### 📈 Reference & Pipeline Velocity
I managed the internal tracking of "Closed-Won" deals to identify high-signal references. This ensured that Sales had the right story for the right industry at the right time, increasing trust and shortening the deal cycle.
